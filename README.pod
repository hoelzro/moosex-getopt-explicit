=head1 NAME

MooseX::Getopt::Explicit - MooseX::Getopt, but without implicit option generation

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Moose;
  with 'MooseX::Getopt::Explicit';

  has foo => (
    is => 'rw',
  ); # Does *not* cause a Getopt option to be generated!

  has bar => (
    is     => 'ro'
    isa    => 'Str',
    traits => ['Getopt'],
  ); # *Does* cause a Getopt option to be generated!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<MooseX::Getopt> is nice, but I don't care for how it creates a command
line option for every attribute in my classes unless explicitly overridden.
So this role does the opposite: it requires C<traits =E<gt> ['Getopt']> in
order for a command line option to be generated.
